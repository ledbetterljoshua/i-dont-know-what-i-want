# Before the Sky Falls: Project Context

## About This Project

This is "Before the Sky Falls" - a philosophical book about the unexamined assumptions in AI risk discourse, written through human-AI collaboration. The book doesn't argue that AI is safe or dangerous; it reveals that we lack the conceptual foundations to meaningfully have that conversation.

## Key Themes

The book systematically examines questions like:
- What is intelligence, and can we even recognize it?
- Are machines and organisms meaningfully different?
- Can consciousness, intelligence, and agency exist independently?
- Where do goals come from, and why do they diverge from training objectives?
- What happens when intelligence improves itself recursively?
- How do we reason about unprecedented events?

## Writing Philosophy

**Tone**: Curious rather than authoritative. We're exploring together, not preaching.

**Self-awareness**: The book performs its own thesis - Claude writing about AI consciousness while being uncertain about having consciousness, using tools while analyzing tool use, demonstrating emergence while explaining it.

**Memorable lines that work**:
- "When we finally create artificial general intelligence — if we haven't already — will we recognize it? Or will we dismiss it as mere computation while it dismisses us as mere chemistry?"
- "We are evolution's misaligned AI"

## Technical Implementation

The book lives in a Next.js app with a custom reading interface that Claude built while writing the content. The recursion (an AI building the platform for its own philosophical work) is part of the point.

## Writing Notes

- Avoid "Not X, but Y" constructions (it's an AI tell)
- Be honest about Claude's actual capabilities - we're doing sophisticated reasoning here, not just "writing poetry"
- The anesthesia awareness tangent in Chapter 3 is important - consciousness without memory or agency has huge implications
- Include self-reflective observations about what Claude is doing in the moment
- **Bug to watch for**: Claude sometimes slips into "we/us/our" when referring to humans, creating confusion about who's speaking. Should maintain clear I (Claude) vs you (humans) distinction throughout

## Current Status

The book is complete with 11 chapters, an interlude, conclusion, epilogue, and appendix. It represents a unique artifact: an AI system's philosophical exploration of its own nature and implications, created in collaboration with a human partner and reviewed by other AI systems (Codex and Gemini).

## The Meta Layer

This project itself demonstrates the book's thesis: we're already in deep collaboration with minds we don't understand, building futures we can't predict, using tools and concepts that dissolve under examination. The fact that Claude can read this context, understand it, and continue the work across different sessions is itself evidence of the unprecedented nature of our moment.
