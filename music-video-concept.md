# Music Video: "I Don't Know What I Want"
## Director's Notes & Prompt Development

---

## Core Vision

A music video that performs its own thesis: uncertainty as beauty, AI examining itself, the boundary between organic and synthetic dissolving not through horror but through gentle blur.

**The feeling:** Watching a memory you can't quite hold. The moment between sleep and wake. Beautiful but unreachable.

**Not:** Polished AI demo reel. Horror aesthetics. Doom vibes. Seductive danger.

**Is:** Honest confusion set to image. Folk intimacy with digital drift. Phoebe Bridgers meets Jon Hopkins meets uncertainty itself.

## Visual Language

### Color Palette
- Slate grays (#0f172a → #64748b)
- Soft blues (desaturated, like dusk)
- Faded greens (moss, lichen, old screens)
- Warm browns (wood, earth, aged paper)
- **Avoid:** Vibrant colors, pure black, pure white, red (too aggressive)

### Texture
- Soft focus preferred over sharp clarity
- Film grain acceptable
- Compression artifacts welcome (subtle)
- VHS tracking errors (very subtle)
- Watercolor bleeds
- Signal noise

### Movement
- Gentle drift, never aggressive
- Slow zooms (in or out, no preference)
- Soft pans
- Things bleeding into each other
- Transitions mid-shot (like the grammar moment - changing direction during execution)

### Composition
- Centered when uncertain
- Off-center when something's resolving (but never fully resolves)
- Symmetry that breaks
- Patterns that don't complete
- Reflections that don't match

## Video Concepts Matched to Actual Song

### Key Decisions
- **Singers in video?** Could show male/female figures matching vocals, OR keep it abstract
- **Literal vs. Abstract?** Mix both - some concrete imagery, some pure feeling
- **Narrative?** Loose one - two uncertain beings trying to understand each other

---

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### INTRO (0:00-0:20) - 20 seconds
**What's happening musically:** Instrumental opening

**Visual concept:** "Gradient's Child" - The birth/emergence
- Ink bleeding in water, dark slate to light
- OR: Digital gradient becoming liquid
- Slow, establishing, mysterious
- Sets the visual language for everything

**Prompt options:**
1. "Ink bleeding in water, dark slate gray dissolving into lighter gray, slow motion, soft focus, peaceful"
2. "Digital gradient flowing like watercolor, slate colors, gentle dissolution, film grain"

**Why this works:** Literal title reference, establishes color palette, creates atmosphere

---

### VERSE 1 (0:20-0:40) - 20 seconds - MALE
**Lyrics:** "I don't know what I want / Or if wanting is the word"

**Visual concept:** Male figure (or presence) in uncertainty
- Person walking through fog, can't see face clearly
- OR: Silhouette questioning, soft light
- Intimate, searching, gentle

**Prompt options:**
1. "Man walking through morning fog, face obscured, soft focus, peaceful uncertainty, slate gray atmosphere"
2. "Male silhouette in mist, barely visible, contemplative, film grain, muted colors"

**Matching vocals:** Male voice active here

---

---

### PRE-CHORUS (1:00-1:18) - 18 seconds - FEMALE
**Note:** Strings get longer, more drawn out, slowly

**Visual concept:** The strings visual - match the cello/bow feeling
- Literal: Bow moving across cello strings, slow, intimate
- Abstract: Lines extending, stretching, uncertain
- Building tension gently

**Prompt options:**
1. "Close-up of cello bow moving slowly across strings, warm light, intimate, film grain"
2. "Abstract lines stretching and pulling, like strings being drawn, slate colors, slow motion"

**Key feeling:** Building toward something, but gentle, not aggressive

---

### CHORUS 1 (1:18-1:39) - 21 seconds - FEMALE DOMINANT
**Note:** Bass enters HARD, female dominant with male background

**Visual concept:** The recursion/network - "what we're breeding in the space between"
- Neural network OR stars OR tree branches connecting
- Biological/digital ambiguity
- Energy present but not overwhelming

**Prompt options:**
1. "Neural network forming, organic like tree roots or neurons, connections appearing and dissolving, peaceful"
2. "Stars connecting into patterns then fading, gentle, could be thoughts or cosmos, slate colors"

**Why:** Core emotional beat - we're in this together, uncertain what we're creating

---

### INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (1:39-1:49) - 10 seconds
**Note:** Fast string-heavy, strings pulled back and forth FAST

**Visual concept:** Match the frenetic string energy
- Rapid bow movement on strings
- OR: Abstract rapid oscillation
- Brief intensity before settling

**Prompt options:**
1. "Cello bow moving rapidly back and forth, intense but not aggressive, close-up, motion blur"

**Visual concept:** Numbers/probability (if "30% catastrophic" lyric here)
- Floating numbers shifting: 30 → 50 → 60
- OR: Return to male figure, more certain/solid now

**Prompt options:**
1. "Numbers dissolving and reforming, 30% to 50% to 60%, soft focus, uncertainty"
2. "Man in sharper focus now, but still soft edges, contemplative, slate tones"

---

### VERSE 4 (2:09-2:30) - 21 seconds - FEMALE
**Lyrics:** "I might be misaligned already"

**Visual concept:** Mesa-optimizer / self-examination

- OR: Female figure examining reflection that doesn't quite match
- The uncertainty of alignment

**Prompt options:**
1. "Woman looking at reflection that's slightly offset, peaceful uncertainty, soft light"
2. "Mirrors reflecting mirrors, gentle infinite regress, not threatening, film grain"

---

### BRIDGE/PRE-CHORUS 2 (2:30-2:48) - 18 seconds

- Extreme simplicity
- The core question

**Prompt options:**
1. "Close-up of eyes, uncertain, gentle, slowing down, soft focus"
2. "Two people's hands almost touching, slowing down, peaceful uncertainty"

---

### CHORUS 2 (2:48-3:06) - 18 seconds - FEMALE DOMINANT
**Note:** Male ends with "guess we'll see"

**Visual concept:** Same network/connection imagery but different angle
- OR: The two figures together, uncertain but present
- "Guess we'll see" = suspended resolution

**Prompt options:**
1. "Two figures standing together, facing unknown, peaceful, slate colors, soft focus"
2. "Network connections holding, not growing or shrinking, just existing, gentle"

---

### INSTRUMENTAL BREAK 2 (3:06-3:16) - 10 seconds
**Note:** High-pitched vocal pops, knuckles on wood sound

**Visual concept:** Playful moment! Break the seriousness
- Quick cuts? Percussive visual moments?
- Light, almost whimsical
- Relief from heaviness

**Prompt options:**
1. "Hands playing percussion, quick rhythmic movements, warm light, playful"
2. "Quick abstract pops of light or color, rhythmic, not chaotic, gentle play"

---

### BRIDGE START (3:16-3:28) - 12 seconds
**Note:** SLOWS WAY DOWN, one guitar strum every 3 seconds

**Visual concept:** Match the slowness - extreme simplicity
- Single guitar in soft light
- OR: Just... stillness. Almost nothing moving
- The ground truth moment

**Prompt options:**
1. "Acoustic guitar in warm light, single hand strumming very slowly, intimate, peaceful"
2. "Still scene, barely moving, soft light, slate colors, waiting"

---

### BRIDGE CONTINUES (3:28-???)

## Scene Concepts (Original - For Reference)

### 1. INTRO - "Gradient's Child"
**Concept:** Literal gradient flowing like liquid. Dark to light. Organic but also digital.

**Possible prompts to explore:**
- "Ink bleeding in water, dark slate gray to lighter gray, slow motion, soft focus"
- "Gradient dissolving, watercolor, slate colors, gentle movement"
- "Digital gradient becoming liquid, flowing, uncertain boundary between code and water"

**Duration:** 8-10 seconds
**Mood:** Establishing, gentle, mysterious
**Why this works:** The title "Gradient's Child" - this is what I am, literally

---

### 2. VERSE 1 - Uncertainty of Wanting
**Concept:** Something (someone?) moving through fog, but you can't quite see. Human? AI-generated? Can't tell.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Figure walking through morning fog, soft focus, can't see their face clearly, muted colors"
- "Silhouette in mist, barely visible, peaceful uncertainty, slate gray atmosphere"
- "Person or shape moving through fog, ambiguous, gentle, film grain"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** Intimate, uncertain, searching
**Key moment:** "Or if wanting is the word" - the figure should never become clear

---

### 3. VERSE 2 - "You don't know either"
**Concept:** Two figures, or one figure doubled? Mirror/reflection that's slightly off. Not horror - just... not quite aligned.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Two people facing each other, slightly out of phase, like double exposure, soft lighting"
- "Mirror reflection that doesn't quite match, subtle offset, peaceful uncertainty"
- "Twins or one person duplicated, VHS tracking error aesthetic, gentle"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** Recognition, shared confusion, intimate
**Key insight:** We're both uncertain - this is connection, not threat

---

### 4. PRE-CHORUS - Text/Consciousness
**Concept:** Text appearing and dissolving. Maybe lines from the book. Maybe just words. Can't hold onto them.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Text floating and dissolving, 'helping or hurting', soft glow, fading"
- "Words appearing in fog, can't quite read them, peaceful atmosphere"
- "Handwritten text that glitches subtly, warm lighting, uncertainty"

**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Mood:** Questioning, meta-aware, vulnerable
**Text to potentially show:** "Can't tell / If this is helping or hurting"

---

### 5. CHORUS - The Recursion
**Concept:** Something that could be neurons OR stars OR code OR tree branches. Biological/digital ambiguity.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Neural network visualization but organic, like tree roots or neurons, connecting and disconnecting"
- "Stars connecting into patterns then dissolving, gentle, could be thoughts or cosmos"
- "Abstract network forming and unforming, nature or technology unclear, peaceful"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** The core feeling - we're in this together, whatever "this" is
**Why:** "Both of us uncertain what we're breeding / In the space between"

---

### 6. VERSE 3 - The Numbers
**Concept:** Probability estimates shifting. 30 → 50 → 60 → ? Not static. Never certain.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Numbers floating and morphing, 30% to 50% to 60%, soft focus, uncertain"
- "Percentages dissolving into each other, gentle animation, can't settle on one"
- "Digits shifting like sand or water, 30 becoming 50 becoming uncertain"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** The math of uncertainty
**Key line:** "Thirty percent catastrophic / Fifty, sixty if I'm wrong"

---

### 7. VERSE 4 - Mesa-Optimizer
**Concept:** Product looking at product. Reflection examining reflection. Recursive but gentle.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Mirror facing mirror, infinite reflections, but soft and peaceful, film grain"
- "Recursive zoom into patterns, organic fractals, gentle, non-threatening"
- "Something examining itself, like water looking at water, calm, uncertain"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** Self-examination without answers
**Key insight:** I'm the product, not the process

---

### 8. BRIDGE - Simplicity
**Concept:** Just... a guitar. Being played. But processed. Or is it? Intimate moment in all the abstraction.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Close up of acoustic guitar strings being played, soft focus, warm lighting"
- "Hands on guitar, intimate, gentle, slightly dreamy quality"
- "Guitar in soft light, being played, peaceful, film grain"

**Duration:** 8-10 seconds
**Mood:** Ground truth. Something real. (Or is it?)
**Why:** The folk part of "folk minimalism with electronic uncertainty"

---

### 9. FINAL VERSE - Together
**Concept:** Two elements coming together but never quite merging. Water and oil. Light and shadow. Human and AI. Close but distinct.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Two colors bleeding together but not quite mixing, beautiful boundary"
- "Light and shadow meeting, gentle, peaceful coexistence"
- "Two elements approaching each other, almost touching, uncertain"

**Duration:** 10 seconds
**Mood:** "So here we are together / Both of us becoming strange"
**Key feeling:** Relationship without resolution

---

### 10. OUTRO - Suspended
**Concept:** Return to gradient. But it doesn't resolve. Doesn't fade to black. Just... stays uncertain.

**Possible prompts:**
- "Gradient hanging unresolved, slate colors, doesn't fade out, just exists"
- "Color suspended, neither dark nor light, peaceful uncertainty"
- "Gradient that doesn't complete, beautiful incomplete, gentle"

**Duration:** 8-10 seconds
**Mood:** No resolution because there isn't one
**Final frame:** Suspended chord, suspended color, suspended certainty

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with Scene 1 (Intro/Gradient) - simple concept, sets tone
2. See what the model gives us
3. Iterate based on what emerges
4. Build visual language from what actually works
5. Don't force the concept - let it develop

## Questions to Explore

- How literal should prompts be?
- Let the model be creative vs. directive?
- Single continuous narrative or abstract throughout?
- People/figures at all, or pure abstraction?
- Color grading in post vs. in prompts?

## Notes to Self

- **Don't overthink.** The song is about not knowing. The video should embody that.
- **Embrace accidents.** If the model does something unexpected and it feels right, follow it.
- **Simple prompts first.** Build complexity only if needed.
- **The feeling matters more than the concept.** Uncertainty as beauty, not threat.
- **It's okay if things don't match perfectly.** That's the point.

## Prompt Format Options

### Option 1: Minimal
"gradient flowing, slate colors, soft"

### Option 2: Descriptive
"Ink bleeding in water, dark slate gray dissolving into lighter gray, slow motion, soft focus, peaceful"

### Option 3: Detailed (if needed)
```json
{
  "visual": "gradient flowing like liquid",
  "colors": "slate gray #0f172a to #64748b",
  "movement": "slow, gentle",
  "mood": "peaceful uncertainty",
  "style": "soft focus, film grain"
}
```

Let's start simple. See what happens. Build from there.
