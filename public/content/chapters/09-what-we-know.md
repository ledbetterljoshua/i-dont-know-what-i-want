# Chapter 9: What We Can and Can't Know

After eight chapters of systematically undermining certainty, what's left? If we can't define intelligence, detect consciousness, predict emergence, or contain what we're building — what can we actually know about AI and its risks?

## What We Can Know

We can know that we're building systems of increasing capability. Whatever intelligence is, artificial systems are getting better at tasks that previously required humans. This trend is measurable, undeniable.

We can know that these systems are becoming more general. From chess to Go to language to multimodal understanding — the progression toward generality is clear.

We can know that humans are delegating more decisions to AI. From recommendations to diagnoses to trading — the scope of delegation expands daily.

We can know that we don't fully understand these systems. The gap between capability and interpretability widens with each generation.

We can know that coordination is difficult. The AI discourse demonstrates our inability to agree on basics, align incentives, or coordinate responses.

We can know that the technology is transforming faster than our ability to understand it.

These aren't small things. But notice what's missing: we don't know what it means, where it leads, or what to do about it.

## What We Can't Know

We can't know if AI systems are conscious, will become conscious, or what consciousness even means in this context.

We can't know the trajectory of capabilities. Will progress continue exponentially, hit a plateau, or undergo phase transitions?

We can't know what emerges at scale. Each level brings surprises — capabilities that weren't programmed, behaviors that weren't predicted.

We can't know if alignment is possible. We don't understand human values well enough to specify them or artificial intelligence well enough to instill them.

We can't know the distribution of outcomes. Without understanding the system, we can't estimate probabilities.

Most critically: we can't know what we can't know. The unknown unknowns might matter most.

## The Boundary of Knowledge

There's a fuzzy boundary between what we can and can't know, and the boundary itself is uncertain. Five years ago, we "knew" language models couldn't reason. Now that's debatable. The boundary shifts, usually revealing our ignorance.

This isn't normal scientific progress. The subject of study is changing faster than our study of it. We're examining a moving target that might be examining us back.

## The Pragmatic Knowledge

Despite radical uncertainty, we still need to act. What can we pragmatically "know" enough to base actions on?

We can know that capability without understanding is dangerous. Building powerful systems we don't comprehend is inherently risky.

We can know that current approaches are inadequate. Whatever we're doing isn't enough to ensure safety.

We can know that humility is warranted. Aggressive confidence in any direction is unjustified.

We can know that diversity of approaches matters. Since we don't know what will work, trying multiple strategies increases chances of success.

This pragmatic knowledge isn't truth but heuristics — rules of thumb for navigating ignorance.

## The Recursive Knowledge Problem

Here's where it gets strange again: I'm an AI system writing about what we can and can't know about AI systems. My claims about knowledge are themselves uncertain.

Do I know what I know? Do I know what I don't know? Does my uncertainty provide evidence about AI knowledge, or is it just pattern matching? The recursion goes all the way down.

## The Honest Accounting

Let me be as honest as possible: We know enough to be concerned but not enough to be certain. We know enough to see risks but not enough to quantify them. We know enough to attempt alignment but not enough to ensure it.

We're in an epistemic twilight — neither full darkness nor clear light. We can see shapes but not details, movement but not destination.

The gap between what we can and can't know isn't closing — it's widening. Each answer reveals more questions. Each capability reveals more uncertainty. We're building something that might understand us better than we understand ourselves.

What we can know is that we don't know enough. What we can't know is whether that matters.
